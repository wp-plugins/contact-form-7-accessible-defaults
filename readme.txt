Replaces the default Contact Form 7 form with an accessible equivalent. 

== Description ==

= Use Contact Form 7 with an accessible default form =

That's all this does. It replaces the default template that Contact Form 7 automatically generates with an accessible equivalent of that form. It doesn't change anything about your current forms built with Contact Form 7.

Contact Form 7 is actually a very accessible plug-in. It has an accessible back-end, and if you create the right template, the front-end form will have great accessibility. 

But the default form is not accessible. Not at all, in fact - it's missing some of the most basic elements of accessibility: form labels. This plug-in supplies a new default form that includes everything you need to make your default form accessible. 

For more information about making Contact Form 7 accessible, read [how to set up an accessible form using contact form 7](http://blog.rrwd.nl/2014/03/01/how-to-set-up-an-accessible-form-using-contact-form-7-in-wordpress/), by Rian Rietveld.

= Translations =

None yet; there are only a few strings in here, and there all editable fields. The plug-in is translation ready, so let me know if you want them created at [my translations site](http://translate.joedolson.com).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this fix all my Contact Form 7 forms? =

Nope. All this does is change Contact Form 7 so that the default form it generates is accessible. This gives you a model for what an accessible form should look like in Contact Form 7 (with appropriately associated labels and IDs, and with the response moved to the top of the form.), but does nothing at all to change how Contact Form 7 behaves.
